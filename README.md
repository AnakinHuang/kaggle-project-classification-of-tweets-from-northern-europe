![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

## 🚀 Overview

This project analyzes a dataset of **509,031 tweets** from politicians across **seven Northern European countries**, aiming to classify tweets by **political spectrum (Left, Right, Center)** and **geography**. Using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and machine learning, we extracted key insights into political discourse and developed a classifier with strong performance.

## 🔬 Methods

### Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

- Text cleaning: Lowercasing, punctuation removal, stopword removal, lemmatization.
- New feature creation: `text_clean_country_gender_user` combining multiple metadata.

### Feature Engineering

- **Vectorization:**
    - Count Vectorizer
    - TF-IDF transformation

### Modeling

- **Classifier:** Linear Support Vector Classifier (LinearSVC)
- **Validation:** 10-fold cross-validation

### Topic Modeling

- **LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation)**
- **NMF (Non-negative Matrix Factorization)**

## 📈 Results

| Metric                      | Value                      |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------|
| Model Accuracy              | 77.38%                     |
| Baseline Accuracy           | ~42.87%                    |
| Topic Modeling Insights     | Identified key political & social themes |
| Hashtag Analysis            | Mapped top hashtags per country |

✅ **Key findings:**
- Tweets span diverse topics from **domestic politics** to **international relations**.
- Different political leanings across countries: e.g., Netherlands leans Center, Iceland leans Left.
- Gender distribution varies: Sweden had a **female-majority**, others skewed male.
